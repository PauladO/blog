I made a little 2048 game to refresh my React and JavaScript skills. I hadn't worked with React in a while, and had never made a React app without Redux. I decided to just make a quick game.

I made a functioning game within a day. It simply calculated the new grid and rendered that, but it made animating the game (almost?) impossible. I switched it to calculating it through JSON objects.

It's still unfinished (the animations are awful, and there's no 'game over' or functioning restart), but it did its job. I refreshed my JavaScript skills and learned more about React without Redux. I could finish it, but I think trying out something with a back end will be more useful.
