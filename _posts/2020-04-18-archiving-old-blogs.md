It's been quite a while since I wrote an actual blog post. The older posts on this blog are not at all representative of what I can do anymore, and so I'm archiving them.

I've progressed a lot over the past two years. I started my career as a developer at a bootcamp (Codaisseur) three years ago, after realizing that a job in the field I was schooled in, communication, was really not working for me. My first job was with a company that did not seem to care about the quality of the code. Being a total rookie, I didn't see this right away, but it became abundantly clear fairly quickly. I did stick around for a while, feeling like I shouldn't just bail on the job right away. I left when I realized they were not interested in changing. Read more about this experience [here]({% post_url 2020-04-18-what-i-learned %}).

I worked for a great company after this. Learned some actual good practice, got code reviews, started focussing on front end development and even got to expand my skills to web design. I am now sort of between jobs (currently on maternity leave, but looking for a job closer to home for when it's finished). It seems time to update this blog and maybe keep it up to date this time.
