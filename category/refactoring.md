title: Refactoring
---

I’m currently working in a 6-7 year old legacy code base, that has never been refactored. It has some very bloated models, some of the controllers contain a lot of business logic, and there is a lot of completely unnecessary
complexity.

So let’s refactor some of that. All variable names have been changed and code is left out. I really don’t like it when people use foo or bar in their examples, because it makes it harder to reason about the code, so instead, I've come up with analogies of our code.
